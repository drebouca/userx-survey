# UX survey

A user experience survey was developed and applied to students using the assessment system in the 2018-19 school year. A total of 423 students were surveyed from statistics classes throughout the school year. 

In order to evaluate the system features, students were assigned to either a treatment or a control group. The treatment group had access to all system features: final score for each assessment, scaffolding (step-by-step solutions), assessment reports with answer keys, and attribute reports with "Novice", "Intermediary", and "Expert" assigned to each skill. The control group only had access to their scores on the assessments.

At the end of the school year the students took the AP statistics exam, and their scores were reported. Students were considered to "Pass" they scored 4 or 5, and to "Fail" otherwise. We first evaluate how students in the treatment group compared in their satisfaction using of the system by AP exam score.
